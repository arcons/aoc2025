--- Day 1: Trebuchet?! ---

Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.

You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all fifty stars by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

You try to ask why they can't just use a weather machine ("not powerful enough") and where they're even sending you ("the sky") and why your map looks mostly blank ("you sure ask a lot of questions") and hang on did you just say the sky ("of course, where do you think snow comes from") when you realize that the Elves are already loading you into a judicial launch tube.

"Just a moment!" you shout. "I don't how to fly."

The Elves assure you that the rocket calibration problem affecting global snow production is meant to be solved by someone like you. It'll be easy!

"You just need to retrieve the calibration document from the Elves and read the instructions."

"Where's the calibration document?"

The tube door slams shut. You hear a muffled "safe place" from the other side.

You're fired into the sky. The calibration document is nowhere to be found.

As the rocket hurtles through the atmosphere, you detect a faint signal on frequency 121.5 MHz. Maybe it's the calibration document? You tune in, but the signal is garbled. You can however see bits of text appearing on your console.

The first puzzle is to extract the calibration values from this text. Each line originally contained a specific calibration value that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.

For example:

1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet

In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.

Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of the calibration values?
