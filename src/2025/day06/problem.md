# Day 6: Trash Compactor

## Problem Description

We are given a grid of text representing math problems.
Problems are separated by a full column of spaces.

### Part 1
Each problem is a vertical column of numbers with an operator (`+` or `*`) at the bottom.
Numbers are read horizontally across each row within a problem block.
All numbers in a problem block are either added or multiplied.

### Part 2
Cephalopod math is read **right-to-left in columns**.
Each number is given in its own column: most significant digit at the top, least significant at the bottom.
The operator is at the bottom of the problem block.

For both parts, calculate the **sum of all problem answers**.

## Input

- A grid of characters (multiple lines).

## Output

- The grand total (sum of all problem results).
