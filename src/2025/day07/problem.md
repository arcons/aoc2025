The puzzle describes a grid representing a "tachyon manifold". In Part 2, a single tachyon particle takes all possible paths. When a particle encounters a splitter ("^"), it creates two timelines: one where it goes to the immediate left of the splitter, and another where it goes to the immediate right. The particle continues to travel downwards.

The objective is to determine the total number of *unique horizontal positions* (timelines) a single tachyon particle can reach after completing all possible journeys through the manifold.
