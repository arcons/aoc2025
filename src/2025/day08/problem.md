The puzzle asks us to simulate connecting junction boxes in 3D space based on their proximity. We are given a list of 3D coordinates, each representing a junction box. The process involves identifying the `1000` pairs of junction boxes with the shortest Euclidean distance between them. We sort all possible pairs by their Euclidean distance and process the 1000 shortest pairs. For each pair, if the two junction boxes are not already in the same circuit (connected component), they are connected, effectively merging their circuits. If they are already in the same circuit, no new connection is formed but this pair still counts towards the "1000 pairs" considered.\n\nAfter processing the 1000 shortest pairs, we need to find the three largest resulting circuits and multiply their sizes together.\n\n**Part 1 Goal:**\nFind the product of the sizes of the three largest circuits after making the 1000 shortest connections.

**Part 2 Goal:**
Identify the pair of junction boxes that, when connected, first results in all junction boxes forming a single connected circuit. Return the product of the X coordinates of these two junction boxes.
