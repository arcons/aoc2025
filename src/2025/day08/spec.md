Input: A list of 3D coordinates, one per line, in the format X,Y,Z. Each coordinate is an integer.\nOutput: An integer representing the product of the sizes of the three largest circuits after making 1000 shortest connections.\n\nExample Input (from description):\n```\n162,817,812\n57,618,57\n906,360,560\n592,479,940\n352,342,300\n466,668,158\n542,29,236\n431,825,988\n739,650,466\n52,470,668\n216,146,977\n819,987,18\n117,168,530\n805,96,715\n346,949,466\n970,615,88\n941,993,340\n862,61,35\n984,92,344\n425,690,689\n```\n\nExpected Output (for 10 shortest connections, as per example):\nThe product of the sizes of the three largest circuits should be `40`. (Circuits sizes: 5, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1). Three largest: 5, 4, 2. Product: 5 * 4 * 2 = 40.\n\nConstraints:\n- Coordinates are integers.\n- Number of junction boxes can be large.

Expected Output for Part 2:
The product of the X coordinates of the last two junction boxes needed to connect for all to be in a single circuit should be `25272`. (Connecting `216,146,977` and `117,168,530` gives 216 * 117 = 25272).
