# Day 9: Movie Theater

## Part 1
Find largest rectangle area defined by two red tiles (coordinates) as opposite corners.
Area = (abs(dx)+1) * (abs(dy)+1).

## Part 2
The red tiles define a polygon (connected sequentially).
The rectangle must be formed by two red tiles as corners, and be fully contained within the polygon (red or green tiles).
Green tiles = boundary + interior of polygon.
Find max area of such a rectangle.
