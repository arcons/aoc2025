# Animation

To view the battle animation:
1. Open `src/2018/day15/viewer_embedded.html` in your web browser.
   - This file contains all the simulation data embedded within it, so it should work without a local server.

## Files
- `generate_animation.ts`: Script that runs the simulation and outputs frames to JSON.
- `animation.json`: Raw frame data.
- `viewer.html`: Viewer that fetches JSON (requires local server).
- `viewer_embedded.html`: Self-contained viewer.
